    <h1>Welcome to Wok</h1>

    <h3>A backend service written in pure Go, backed by PostgreSql</h3>

    <p>Wok is not the most intuitive backend, its not the fastest, its probably no ones first choice,
        but its what I'm proud of to work on, even if it can't be what large OS projects or corporations are 
        designing everyday. Wok is a project I feel proud enough to say is not going to stand up to the fastest
        frameworks and design patterns on the market.
    </p>

    <br>
    <i>Why create Wok?</i>
    <p>I created wok cause I felt frameworks in Go take themselves too seriosuly, constant pressure to be the
        fastest, lowest latency, or claiming a design pattern that is syntactically superior to others.
        Wok is supposed to be the breath of fresh air to that, it really is only going to get one thing off the ground
        for you, the users. Even that is not backed by a complicated system. It uses postgres to manage users. No redis,
        no vector databases, no complicated locking and unlocking of user management across systems. Its all in one place.
    </p>

    <p>Wok also by default doesn't use a highly customizable router or a complicated regex system that validates requests in 
        magical ways. Its just some simple validation using net/http.
    </p>

    <p>By no means do I claim to be a "standard library guru" in fact I despise people who flame others for not bootstrapping everyday
        project with the SL. Its just that the SL is well documented and users can always build on top of it without the fear of 
        breaking an open source maintainers precious magical code. 
    </p>

    <p>Go is an incredible language, but the community has locked itself into the microservice, multi service architecture. Most 
        developers will never need that level of abstraction, it might actually make their services perform worse compared to others.
        But Wok gives the power back to the developer to make what they want, how they want it. Its up to the developer how they want
        to season it.
